Add a Business Directory or Directory of Links in different categories and pages.  Show website thumbnails of Links with Url's.

== Description ==

All your users to submit links to a directory.  This could be used for a business
directory when you allow full address and contact information on the form.  Or you 
could just keep it to a description and link.  Just plug in Wp-Directory-list and start
adding links.

Manage your categories easily.  Just add the category and activate it.  Now it is ready to use in a link and page.

Manage the links easily by allowing your users to submit a link.  Links can also be added manually.

The links integrate easily with your own theme.  No CSS to configure as it uses the CSS from your current theme. Or build your own CSS just for the links. Just customize the way your Links show up with the Built in tags, text and your own html.  Put multiple links in each row.

Add a widget to your sidebar with Random Links, Popular Links or Newest Links.

Keep robot submissions to a minimum by requiring users to be logged in and solving a Captcha code.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The Plugin pages keep showing a 404 error. =

I hate to say it but you probably downloaded the wrong version.  Please make sure the directory for the plugin says wp-directory-list.  If it is not that directory this plugin will not work correctly.

= The shortcodes are not working. =

Make certain that you do not have a space just after the opening brace or one just before the closing brace.
